## Overview
There are two types of Challenges in this course. Each one is designed to prepare you for a scenario that you're likely to encounter as a web developer.

### The challenge
Challenges adhere to a format that's commonly used by software development teams that use **agile project management** to manage their work. Practicing this will prepare you for the workflows you'll experience as a professional full-stack web developer. 

### User Story
This is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who is requesting the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system.

.benefit-brand h3 .benefit-cost h3 .benefit-lead h3 {

I want to learn more CSS and practice how to style a page without googling most of the elements

w3schools.com/cssref/sel_element.asp- This helped me because it explained a lot of the CSS terminology
